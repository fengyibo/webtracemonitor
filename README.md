# Web Trace Monitor

Viewing realtime trace messages in modern browsers.

![Alt text](./doc/Screenshot.png)


## Introduction

Web Trace Monitor is an open-source, purely html-based, real-time log console similar to [DebugView] or [Chainsaw]. It enables watching real-time traces in most modern browsers without the need for any plugin. The web application can be installed on Windows Azure Websites, Windows Azure WebRoles or any other Windows Server running IIS and ASP.NET 4.5. 

It provides an unsecured, public REST endpoint, where trace messages can be posted to. For .NET developers a System.Diagnostics compatible trace listener exists for convenience. 

Web Trace Monitor uses [SignalR] to forward incoming trace messages to all connected browsers in near realtime.

Data is displayed with the means of the underlying [SlickGrid] and kept entirely in memory of the web browser until cleared. This enables quick filtering by machine or trace level. The usage of virtual Scrolling ensures, that web trace monitor can even deal with hundreds of thousands of trace messages.

The main purpose of the Web Trace Monitor tool is to serve as a public hub for traces from _all_ machines and devices and by displaying them in real-time, providing insight into the flow of a distributed system during development and testing. One example would be a Windows Azure Cloud Service  consisting of multiple roles.

See a [Demo].  

## Release

The current release in the master branch is version 0.8.00 (BETA). Tested with latest versions of IE, Chrome, FireFox and Opera. 

## Installation

### Windows Azure Websites

The easiest way to deploy Web Trace Monitor is by publishing it directly from GitHub to a Windows Azure Website:

+ Create a Fork of the [master] branch on GitHub
+ Create a new WebSite with the Windows Azure Management Portal 
+ On the Dashboard of the Website in Azure click "Set up deployment from source control"
+ Choose GitHub and approve the authorization request.
+ Next you need to choose the Repository Name and branch. Choose your fork of the Web Trace Monitor.

The deployment is started automatically and after it has finished you should be able to access your instance of Web Trace Monitor.

### Windows Azure Web Role

+ Clone the repo
+ Open the solution with Visual Studio 2012
+ Publish the project WebTraceMonitor.Azure to your Windows Azure subscription
+ Make sure, your role is configured with exactly 1 instance. Multiple instances are not supported at the moment.

### Other IIS

+ Clone the repo
+ Open the solution with Visual Studio 2012
+ Publish the WebTraceMonitor web project e.g. with WebDeploy to IIS server. NOTE: web farms are not supported at the moment.

## Creating trace messages

Today there are two ways to send trace messages to Web Trace Monitor: REST API and System Diagnostics Trace Listener.

### REST API

Each instance of Web Trace Monitor creates a public REST endpoint at `/api/v1/trace`. 

Example Http request header and body:

    POST
    http://webtracemonitordemo.azurewebsites.net/api/v1/trace HTTP/1.1
    Content-type: application/json
    Host: webtracemonitordemo.azurewebsites.net
    Content-Length: 225
  
    { "Message": "Object reference not set to an instance of an object", 
      "Level": "Error", 
      "TimeStamp": "2013-04-05 17:53:00.000", 
      "Machine":"R2D2", 
      "Category":"Errors", 
      "Source":"MyApplication", 
      "ProcessId":765, 
      "ThreadId":345 }
    

### System Diagnostics Trace Listener

.NET programmers can use the System Diagnostics Trace Listener that effectively wraps the REST API.

The `WebTraceMonitor.SystemDiagnosticsTraceListener.dll` can be downloaded from [here].

To use it in your own project, reference the dll and add the following configuration to your app.config / web.config: 

    <system.diagnostics>
        <trace>
          <listeners>
            <add type="WebTraceMonitor.SystemDiagnosticsTraceListener.WebMonitorTraceListener, 
                WebTraceMonitor.SystemDiagnosticsTraceListener" 
                name="WebTraceMonitor" host="yoursite.azurewebsites.net" port="80">
              <filter type="" />
            </add>
          </listeners>
        </trace>
    </system.diagnostics>

DonÂ´t forget to set `host` and `port` to your instance of Web Trace Monitor. 

If the listener is used within an Azure Role, it is also necessary to add the following settings to service configuration in addition to the registration of the listener in app/web config:

    <ConfigurationSettings>
      <Setting name="WebTraceMonitor.Host" value="mysite.azurewebsites.net" />
      <Setting name="WebTraceMonitor.Port" value="80" />
      <Setting name="WebTraceMonitor.Enabled" value="true" />
    </ConfigurationSettings>

This allows to change the values during runtime without re-deploying. If `host` and `port` are configured in app/web.config and service configuration, the service configuration has higher precedence.


Now all calls to `System.Diagnostics` trace methods like `Trace.TraceInformation`, `Trace.TraceError` etc. are sent to the Web Trace Monitor.

IMPORTANT NOTE: the trace listener is doing an asynchronous web request on each single trace-method call. If the remote server is not available, the trace message will be lost. Heavy tracing will result in heavy network activity. For these reasons it is not recommended to use this trace listener in production. 



## Contributions / Feedback

If you find Web Trace Monitor useful and create other native Wrappers for the REST API, submit them as PULL requests. Good candidates would be listeners/appenders for log4net, nlog, log4j and other common logging frameworks.

If you have any feedback, questions or ideas for enhancements, please use the GitHub issues.
